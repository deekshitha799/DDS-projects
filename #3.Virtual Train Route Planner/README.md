📄 README / Project Report Description
1. Executive Summary

The Virtual Train Route Planner is a Python-based simulation that helps navigate train stations in real-time. It uses a doubly linked list to allow forward and backward navigation along routes, and a circular linked list to manage looped train routes (like metro systems). This project demonstrates how linked lists can model real-world transport systems effectively.

2. Project Overview

Problem Statement:
Railway route planning requires a system where passengers can move forward and backward across stations and also handle circular routes like metros. Without proper simulation, planning and navigation become confusing.

Project Goals & Objectives:

Model train stations using linked lists.

Enable forward and backward movement.

Handle circular train routes efficiently.

Provide a clear and interactive simulation for route planning.

3. Features

🚉 Add Stations: Add multiple stations to the route.

⏩ Forward Navigation: Move to the next station.

⏪ Backward Navigation: Move to the previous station.

🔄 Circular Routes: Automatically loop routes if circular option is enabled.

📋 View Current Route: Display list of stations in order.

4. Advantages & Disadvantages

Advantages:

Easy navigation through stations.

Circular routes mimic real-world metro systems.

Doubly linked list provides efficient two-way movement.

Extensible for future features (ticketing, scheduling).

Disadvantages:

Only one route handled at a time (no multi-route system yet).

Circular navigation may confuse new users if not properly explained.

5. How It Is Useful & Real-Life Applications

Usefulness:

Helps students learn data structures (linked lists) in a real-world context.

Useful for simulating metro/train routes for educational projects.

Real-Life Applications:

Metro/train navigation systems.

Ticket booking platforms (route validation).

Transport simulation in smart city projects.

6. Project Methodology

Data Structures Used:

Doubly Linked List → Forward & Backward navigation.

Circular Linked List → Looped routes.

Design:

Each station = Node.

Links = Connections between stations.

Head node = First station in the route.

7. How to Run the Project

Steps to Run:

Install Python 3.x.

Save the file as train_route_planner.py.

Open terminal/command prompt in the file’s directory.

Run:

python train_route_planner.py


Use menu options to add stations, move forward/backward, and view the route.
