üìå Data Structures Project Showcase
1. Executive Summary

The Chat Message History Manager is designed to enhance user communication by providing an efficient way to store, track, and manage chat messages with undo/redo functionality.

Problem Solved: Accidental message sending, loss of context, lack of history management.

Core Approach: Uses queues (for storage) and stacks (for undo/redo).

Significance: Improves productivity, accuracy, and user control in communication platforms.

2. Project Overview
Problem Statement

In modern communication, users struggle with:

Losing message context

Accidental message sending

No undo/redo option

Inefficient history tracking

Goals & Objectives

‚úî Develop a robust system to manage chat messages.
‚úî Implement undo/redo using stack operations.
‚úî Integrate timestamp tracking.
‚úî Ensure a lightweight, scalable, and user-friendly solution.

3. Features

Message Storage: Queue-based message management.

Undo/Redo Operations: Stack-based revert and restore.

Timestamp Tracking: Logs time for each message.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy to navigate and operate.

Real-Time Updates: Instant reflection of actions.

Scalability: Works with any chat-based system.

4. Advantages & Disadvantages
‚úÖ Advantages

6. Project Methodology
Technologies & Tools

Language: C++ / Java / Python

Data Structures: Queue (storage), Stack (undo/redo)

Design Process

Define requirements & data structure flow.

Implement message queue with timestamps.

Add stack-based undo/redo.

Build simple user interaction functions.

Testing & Validation

Unit tests for queue & stack operations.

Real-time chat simulation tests.

Boundary condition handling (e.g., empty stack, overflow).

7. How to Run the Project
Steps to Run:

Install Python 3.x.

Save code as chat_manager.py.

Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.

Run the program:

python chat_manager.py


Use the menu to Add, Undo, Redo, or View Messages.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

No external libraries required

8. Example Output
Adding messages...
Message 1 stored at 10:01 AM
Message 2 stored at 10:02 AM
Message 3 stored at 10:03 AM

Undo last message...
Message 3 removed from history

Redo last undone message...
Message 3 restored successfully

Displaying all messages with timestamps...
1. Message 1 - [10:01 AM]
2. Message 2 - [10:02 AM]
3. Message 3 - [10:03 AM]


‚úÖ Demonstrates:

Queue-based storage

Stack-based undo/redo

Accurate timestamp tracking

9. Conclusion

The Chat Message History Manager effectively solves key communication problems through queues, stacks, and timestamps. It is practical, scalable, and future-ready with possibilities like cloud storage, AI message suggestions, and advanced search.
